Want to Rebuild Public Trust - Focus on Civic Education
===============================================================================

Good ideas for rebuilding public trust by focusing on the diminishing role of facts and analysis (Truth Decay) in public life.

Suggests include shifting funding and focus towards Civic education and awareness. Four top suggestions:

1. Use more hands-on learning like simuations and mock-trials
2. Cross disciplinary education of civics in subjects like Art (color theory for campaigns), math (understanding polls and margins of error)
3. Embrace controversial policy discussions and use Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)to navigate conflicts
4. Support initiatives for better access to higher quality/vetted civic information and activities for students of all income levels
