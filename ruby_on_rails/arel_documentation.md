DOCUMENTATION FOR AREL HAS BEEN MOVED AND IS NO LONGER A PUBLIC API
================================================================================

2021-05-06

Since the `Arel` gem was moved to be part of `ActiveRecord`, it is no longer
considered to have a public API. However the previous documentation for it can
be found at the (V9.0.0)[https://github.com/rails/arel/tree/v9.0.0] tag

ref: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/32723
